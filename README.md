divecFestMobile
===============

Take a look at the site hosted in [Heroku](http://divecfestmobile.herokuapp.com)

A mobile friendly version of the official [schedule](http://divecfest.cucei.udg.mx) for divecFest 2013

# Motivation

Since last year, divecFest official page had serious problems when you try to access from either a smartphone or a tablet so I decided to create a mobile-friendly version of the site.

DivecFest is going to be held on May 13th and 14th but I started to working on this project since May 11th and I have to ask for help in the front-end and, thankfully, my friend [Gio Mendoza](https://github.com/mendozagioo) gave me a hand and the project was ready for the event.

# Technical description

I decided to create the site as a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web application because I wanted to learn Sinatra and I considered Rails being too much complicated for this project.


The information is taken from the official site using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org)

*Note*:
As I said before, this is my first Sinatra app and it may have lots of errors talking about the app structure. Any advice about how to improve it is appreciated as well as any issue that may appear.
